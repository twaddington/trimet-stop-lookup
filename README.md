Where's my bus? That's usually the question running through my mind when
I'm waiting at the bus stop. Thanks to the real-time
[TriMet REST API](http://developer.trimet.org/) it's a simple matter
to answer that question.

This website provides an easy way to query the TriMet API for the next
transit arrivals at a particular stop.
